## Task 5.2 Completion â€“ Backend for Wardrobe Permissions (Visibility Field & Endpoints)

Status: PARTIAL COMPLETE (Core visibility enum + endpoints shipped; existing permissions route already present). Remaining: integrate frontend & expand tests with auth token mocking.

### Implemented
* Prisma schema: Added `WardrobeVisibility` enum (`private|friends|public`) and `wardrobeVisibility` field to `User` model (default `private`).
* New API: `GET /api/visibility` & `PUT /api/visibility` (authenticated) to fetch/update user visibility.
* Server mount: Added route to `server.js`.
* Placeholder Jest test scaffold (`backend/test/visibility.test.js`).

### Existing Functionality Reused
* Original granular sharing booleans remain in `WardrobePermission` for fine-grained control; visibility enum adds high-level mode.

### Migration Notes
Run a new Prisma migration to apply enum + column. (Generate migration and deploy in your environment.)

### Follow-Up (Task 5.3 prerequisites)
1. Frontend service method to load/update visibility (replace localStorage stub in `profilePreferences.ts`).
2. Merge visibility selector to call backend endpoints (optimistic update, rollback on error).
3. Strengthen tests: mock auth context / JWT, assert persistence.
4. Backfill migration file (not auto-generated here) and run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_wardrobe_visibility` locally.

### Risk / Considerations
* Ensure existing clients ignore new field until integrated (non-breaking, has default).
* Add index or partial caching later if read frequency high.
