  - State machine for workflow management (upload → generating → viewing)
  - Progress indicator with visual step tracking
  - Avatar collection display with thumbnails
  - Integration with authentication system
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 Technology Integration

### 3D Graphics Stack
- **React Three Fiber:** Declarative Three.js integration for React
- **@react-three/drei:** Helper components and utilities
- **three-stdlib:** Standard Three.js extensions
- **GLTF Loader:** 3D model loading and rendering

### Avatar Generation
- **Ready Player Me API:** Professional avatar generation service
- **Selection Rationale:**
  - High-quality realistic avatars with consistent results
  - Comprehensive documentation and reliable API
  - Cost-effective pricing model ($0.50 per avatar)
  - Strong community support and regular updates

### Type Safety & Error Handling
- **TypeScript Interfaces:** Complete type definitions for all avatar operations
- **Error Boundaries:** Graceful degradation for component failures
- **Toast Notifications:** User-friendly error reporting
- **Loading States:** Comprehensive feedback during async operations

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### 1. Authentication Check
- Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users
- Loading states during authentication verification
- Seamless integration with existing auth system

### 2. Avatar Creation Workflow
```
Step 1: Upload Photo
├── Drag-and-drop or camera capture
├── Real-time image validation
├── Quality checks and guidelines
└── Preview with cropping area

Step 2: Generate Avatar
├── Progress tracking with estimated time
├── Real-time status updates
├── Background processing with polling
└── Error handling with retry options

Step 3: Customize & Use
├── Interactive 3D viewer
├── Customization controls
├── Avatar collection management
└── Integration with wardrobe system
```

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Avatar Collection:** Display of user's multiple avatars with metadata
- **Customization Options:** Body type, height, skin tone adjustments
- **Wardrobe Integration:** Placeholder for trying on clothes
- **Social Features:** Avatar sharing and preset management

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### Error Handling Scenarios
1. **Network Failures:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Invalid Images:** User-friendly validation messages
3. **API Rate Limits:** Graceful degradation with user notification
4. **3D Rendering Issues:** Fallback to static previews
5. **Authentication Errors:** Seamless re-authentication flow

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading:** 3D components loaded only when needed
2. **Image Optimization:** Automatic compression and format conversion
3. **Caching Strategy:** Avatar metadata and thumbnails cached locally
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without 3D support

### Browser Compatibility

- Automatic token management for API calls
- User session persistence across avatar operations

### Backend Requirements
The frontend is designed to work with these backend endpoints:
```
POST /api/avatars/upload-selfie     # Image upload
POST /api/avatars/create           # Avatar generation
GET  /api/avatars/status/:id       # Progress tracking
GET  /api/avatars/user            # User's avatars
GET  /api/avatars/:id             # Specific avatar data
```
