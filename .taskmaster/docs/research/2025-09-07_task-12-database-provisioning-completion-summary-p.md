# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Task 1.2 Database Provisioning completion summary: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MinIO all successfully configured and tested. Schema migration completed with Prisma. Collections created in MongoDB for avatar metadata, garment analysis, user analytics, and AI model metadata. All CRUD operations validated. Infrastructure ready for WardrobeAI development.

**Response:**

Of course. Here is a medium-detail research response to the database provisioning summary, incorporating the provided project context.

### **Analysis of Database Provisioning Completion (Task 1.2)**

The completion of Task 1.2, "Database Provisioning," is a critical milestone that marks the transition from foundational setup to feature development for the WardrobeAI project. The successful configuration and testing of PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO provide a robust and scalable data layer that directly supports the immediate high-priority tasks.

This summary confirms that the core data infrastructure is not just planned but is now operational, de-risking the subsequent development phases.

### **Impact on Active and Upcoming Tasks**

The provisioned database infrastructure directly unblocks and informs the development of several key tasks.

**1. Immediate Impact (Tasks Now Unblocked):**

*   **Task 2: MVP Avatar Creation System (High Priority)**
    *   **How it's unblocked:** The development team for Task 2 can now begin implementation immediately.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   **Selfie Storage:** The service that handles selfie uploads can now be built to store the source image files directly in the **MinIO** object storage bucket.
        *   **Avatar Data:** Upon successful generation of the 3D avatar, the resulting model files (.glb, .fbx) and textures can be stored in **MinIO**.
        *   **Metadata Management:** The `avatar metadata` collection in **MongoDB** is ready to be populated. This will store pointers to the model files in MinIO, along with user IDs, generation parameters, and preset pose configurations. The flexible schema of MongoDB is ideal for this evolving data.

*   **Task 3: Virtual Wardrobe and Garment Upload (High Priority)**
    *   **How it's unblocked:** This task is entirely dependent on the data layer and can now proceed.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   **Garment Image Storage:** The garment upload endpoint can be developed to save user-submitted clothing photos to **MinIO**.
        *   **AI Analysis Results:** The AI service for garment analysis (categorization, color detection) has a destination for its output. The `garment analysis` collection in **MongoDB** is ready to store this rich, semi-structured JSON data (e.g., `{itemId: "...", userId: "...", category: "t-shirt", colorHex: "#0000FF", tags: ["casual", "summer"]}`).

*   **Task 1: Core Infrastructure and User Authentication (In-Progress)**
    *   **How it's advanced:** The user authentication sub-task can now be completed.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   **User Data:** The Google OAuth2/Firebase Auth integration can now be finalized by creating and linking user profiles in the **PostgreSQL** database, for which the schema has been migrated via Prisma. This table will hold core user identity, email, and foreign keys to other data.

**2. Secondary Impact (Informing Future Tasks):**

*   **Task 8: Fashion AI Stylist V1 (High Priority)**
    *   **Data Foundation:** The AI team can now design their models with the knowledge that user wardrobe data will reside in the `garment analysis` **MongoDB** collection. They can begin writing data loaders and pre-processing scripts against this defined schema. The `AI model metadata` collection is also ready to store versions and parameters for the stylist models themselves.

*   **Task 4: Virtual Outfit Try-On (High Priority)**
    *   **API Design:** The team can begin designing the APIs required to fetch data for the try-on experience. They know they will need to query **MongoDB** for avatar and garment metadata and then use that information to retrieve the corresponding 3D assets from **MinIO**.

*   **Task 10: Monetization Foundation (Low Priority)**
    *   **Ledger Backend:** The choice of **PostgreSQL** is validated for this task. The backend team can confidently design the transactional ledger for the 'Threads' currency, knowing the database supports the required integrity and relational constraints (e.g., linking transactions to users).

### **Data Storage Strategy Confirmation**

Based on the provisioning summary and project needs, the data storage strategy is confirmed as follows:

| Data Type | Storage System | Rationale | Relevant Tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Accounts & Profiles** | **PostgreSQL** | Structured, relational data requiring high integrity. Managed by Prisma. | 1, 2, 3, 10 |
| **In-App Currency Ledger** | **PostgreSQL** | Requires ACID compliance for financial transactions. | 10 |
| **User-Uploaded Selfies & Garment Photos** | **MinIO** | Unstructured binary files (images). S3-compatible object storage is ideal. | 2, 3 |
| **Generated 3D Avatars & Clothing Models** | **MinIO** | Large binary assets (3D models, textures). | 2, 4 |
| **Avatar & Garment Metadata** | **MongoDB** | Flexible, semi-structured data from AI analysis. Fast reads for complex objects. | 2, 3, 4, 8 |
| **User Analytics & AI Model Metadata** | **MongoDB** | Schemaless nature is perfect for logging diverse events and storing model parameters. | (Internal), 8 |
| **User Sessions & Caching** | **Redis** | Fast, in-memory key-value store for ephemeral data like session tokens and frequently accessed data to reduce database load. | 1, 4 |

### **Conclusion & Next Steps**

The infrastructure team has successfully laid the digital foundation for the WardrobeAI application. The backend and AI teams are now unblocked on the highest priority Phase 1 features.

**Recommended immediate actions:**
1.  **API Endpoint Development:** Teams for Tasks 2 and 3 should commence building the API endpoints for file uploads (to MinIO) and metadata creation (in MongoDB).
2.  **Finalize User Auth:** The Task 1 team should complete the Google Auth integration, populating the PostgreSQL `users` table.
3.  **Data Contract Socialization:** Share the confirmed data storage strategy (table above) with all development teams to ensure alignment as they design and build their respective services.
