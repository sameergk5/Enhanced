			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Core Infrastructure and User Authentication Setup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Core Infrastructure and User Authentication Setup' into 8 detailed subtasks. Break down the existing work into more granular steps, creating separate subtasks for: 1) Kubernetes cluster provisioning and networking setup, 2) CI/CD pipeline configuration for backend microservices, 3) PostgreSQL database provisioning and user schema initialization, 4) MongoDB/DynamoDB provisioning and configuration, 5) Backend Google OAuth endpoint implementation and JWT generation, 6) Web client (Next.js) scaffolding and environment setup, 7) Mobile client (React Native/Flutter) scaffolding and environment setup, and 8) Frontend integration for the full Google login flow and session management.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it spans the entire technology stack: backend microservices, container orchestration (Kubernetes), multiple database types, and two separate frontend clients (web and mobile). The coordination and integration between these disparate, foundational components, plus the critical security aspect of authentication, justify the high score."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Monetization Foundation: In-App Currency and Skins",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Monetization Foundation: In-App Currency and Skins' into 7 subtasks. Focus on separating the work by component and platform. Create subtasks for: 1) Backend 'Threads' currency ledger service and API, 2) Backend server-side receipt validation service for IAPs, 3) iOS client integration with StoreKit for purchasing 'Threads', 4) Android client integration with Google Play Billing for purchasing 'Threads', 5) Shared Store UI for browsing and purchasing skins, 6) Backend logic to deduct currency and add skins to a user's inventory, and 7) Frontend integration to equip/unequip purchased skins on the avatar.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is high due to the integration with external, platform-specific payment systems (Apple StoreKit, Google Play Billing), which have strict and complex validation requirements. Building a secure and reliable backend ledger for virtual currency is also a critical and non-trivial task."
		},

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Fashion AI Stylist V1",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Fashion AI Stylist V1' into 5 subtasks. The breakdown should cover the entire development lifecycle of the recommendation engine. Create subtasks for: 1) Research and formalize the style rules, color matching, and pairing logic into a specification, 2) Develop the backend recommendation engine service that processes a user's wardrobe against the rules, 3) Create the API endpoint to request and receive outfit suggestions for a given item, 4) Implement the frontend UI component to display the recommended items, and 5) Develop a test suite with sample wardrobes to validate the quality and relevance of suggestions.",
			"reasoning": "While labeled 'AI', the V1 implementation is described as a rule-based system, which is less complex and uncertain than training a novel ML model. The complexity is moderate, stemming from the need to design a robust and extensible rules engine and integrate it effectively with user data."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "MVP Avatar Creation System",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'MVP Avatar Creation System' into 10 granular subtasks, reflecting its high R&D nature. The breakdown should separate AI model work, backend processing, and client-side rendering. Include subtasks for: 1) Research and selection of a 3D face reconstruction model/API, 2) Backend service to manage the photo-to-3D model processing pipeline, 3) Integration with the chosen 3D rendering engine (e.g., Unity), 4) Mobile UI for selfie capture with quality guidance, 5) Avatar model optimization and rigging for mobile performance, 6) Implementation of preset poses and animations, 7) Texture and material mapping on the generated model, 8) Error handling and user feedback for failed avatar generation, 9) API for fetching and displaying the user's avatar, and 10) End-to-end performance testing on target devices.",
			"reasoning": "This task is exceptionally complex, involving significant R&D in AI-driven 3D model generation from a single image. Integrating this computationally intensive process with a real-time 3D rendering engine on mobile devices, while ensuring high performance and realism, represents a major technical and research challenge."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Virtual Wardrobe and Garment Upload",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Virtual Wardrobe and Garment Upload' into 6 subtasks. Separate the frontend UI work from the backend processing and AI components. Create subtasks for: 1) Frontend UI for the wardrobe grid and item detail view, 2) Frontend image upload component and flow, 3) Backend API endpoint for receiving images and triggering processing, 4) AI service integration for image processing (item categorization, color detection, style tagging), 5) Database schema and service for storing wardrobe items and their metadata, and 6) Error handling and UI feedback for the upload and processing states.",
			"reasoning": "The task combines standard full-stack development (UI, API, database) with the integration of an AI/Computer Vision component. While the AI part may use existing services, the pipeline for processing, tagging, and storing the results for each user's items adds moderate complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Initial UI Modes and Theming Engine",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Initial UI Modes and Theming Engine' into 4 focused subtasks. The breakdown should separate design, architecture, and implementation. Create subtasks for: 1) Finalize and export all UI assets (color palettes, fonts, icons) for the Bubbly, Bro, and Professional themes, 2) Implement the core theming engine/provider in the client application (web and mobile), 3) Apply the three distinct themes across all existing UI components to ensure consistency, and 4) Create the user settings interface to select and persist the chosen theme.",
			"reasoning": "This is a well-contained frontend task. The complexity is moderate and lies in architecting a scalable theming system and applying it consistently, rather than in complex business logic or backend integration. It is less complex than features requiring full-stack or AI development."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Virtual Outfit Try-On and Styling Interface",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Virtual Outfit Try-On and Styling Interface' into 8 subtasks, acknowledging its high complexity in 3D rendering and system integration. Create subtasks for: 1) API integration to fetch user avatar and wardrobe data, 2) Logic to map 2D wardrobe items to 3D wearable assets/textures, 3) Implementing the core rendering logic to apply a single clothing item to the avatar model, 4) Developing a layering system to handle multiple garments correctly (e.g., shirt under a jacket), 5) Building the swipe-based UI for outfit combination previews, 6) Implementing basic clipping prevention for clothing, 7) Performance optimization for smooth rendering on mobile devices, and 8) State management for saving and naming created outfits.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity is very high because it integrates two other complex systems (avatar and wardrobe) and introduces a major new challenge: real-time 3D rendering of clothing on a rigged model. This involves complex geometry, layering logic, and significant performance optimization, making it one of the most difficult features to implement."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Community Feature: Anonymous Look Rating",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Community Feature: Anonymous Look Rating' into 5 subtasks, focusing on the full user flow from submission to feedback. Create subtasks for: 1) Backend service and database schema for submitting, storing, and queuing 'looks' for rating, 2) Backend logic to anonymously serve looks to raters and aggregate scores, 3) Frontend UI for a user to create and submit a 'look' to the community, 4) Frontend 'rating' interface where users can view and rate anonymous looks, and 5) Frontend 'my results' screen for users to view aggregated feedback on their submissions.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard social feature involving full-stack development (CRUD operations, UI/UX). The business logic for anonymity and aggregation adds a layer of work, but it does not involve R&D, 3D rendering, or complex external APIs, placing its complexity in the medium range."
