# Task 5.5 – Native Sharing Dialog & Fallback

Status: Completed (Initial Implementation)
Date: 2025-09-08

## Scope

Adds ability for users to share captured outfit/Avatar render:

- Share service `shareAvatar.ts` using Web Share API (files) when available.
- Extended `Avatar3DViewer` with Share button (enabled after capture) and fallback modal.
- Fallback provides Download + Copy URL options when native share not supported or fails.
- Reuses existing capture logic & `buildCapturedAvatarImage` utility.

## UX Flow

1. User renders outfit.
2. User taps Capture → image blob cached & callback triggered.
3. Share button becomes active.
4. If `navigator.share` exists and (optionally) `canShare` supports files, native share invoked.
5. Otherwise a lightweight modal appears with download and copy URL actions.

## Files Added / Modified

- Added: `src/services/shareAvatar.ts` (share logic)
- Modified: `src/components/avatar/Avatar3DViewer.tsx` (share UI & fallback modal)

## Implementation Notes

- Avoided unused TypeScript suppression by runtime narrowing (`const nav: any = navigator`).
- Ensures capture result retained in component state (`captured`) for subsequent share attempts.
- Fallback modal overlays viewer without affecting underlying render state.

## Follow-ups (Optional)

- Add toast notifications for share success/error.
- Provide social network deep links (e.g., X/Twitter, Threads) with pre-populated text.
- Integrate analytics events for share attempts and method used.
- Auto-generate alt text describing outfit items for accessibility when sharing.

## Completion Criteria

- Share button present & functional post-capture: Achieved.
- Native share path with graceful fallback: Implemented.
- No TypeScript or lint errors introduced: Verified.

Task 5.5 initial implementation complete.
