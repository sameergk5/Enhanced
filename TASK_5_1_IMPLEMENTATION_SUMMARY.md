## Task 5.1 Completion – Create Profile Settings UI

Status: COMPLETE (Frontend-only implementation)

### Scope Implemented

* New `Profile` page route at `/profile` (lazy loaded in existing router)
* Wardrobe visibility selection UI with three options: Private / Friends / Public
* Local persistence via `localStorage` stub service (to be replaced by backend in Tasks 5.2 & 5.3)
* Accessible radio-style cards with keyboard & screen-reader support
* Placeholder profile fields (Display Name, Bio) marked as forthcoming
* Vitest + Testing Library test coverage for core selector behaviors

### Files Added

* `src/services/profilePreferences.ts` – temporary persistence layer
* `src/components/profile/WardrobeVisibilitySelector.tsx` – visibility selector component
* `src/pages/Profile.tsx` – profile management screen
* `__tests__/profileVisibility.test.tsx` – unit tests
* `TASK_5_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – this report

### Not In Scope (Deferred)

* Backend schema changes (`wardrobeVisibility` field) – Task 5.2
* API integration (GET/PUT) – Task 5.3
* Editing and saving Display Name & Bio – blocked pending backend

### Next Steps

1. Implement backend `wardrobeVisibility` enum field & endpoints (Task 5.2)
2. Replace local storage service with real API integration (Task 5.3)
3. Extend tests to cover API-driven persistence once backend available

### Verification

* Selector renders & toggles correctly; state persists across re-renders (localStorage)
* All tests passing (run via `vitest`)

Prepared for continuation with Task 5.2.
