# Task 5.3 â€“ Integrate Profile Settings Frontend with Backend

Status: Completed
Date: 2025-09-08

## Scope

Replaced frontend-only wardrobe visibility persistence (localStorage) with authoritative backend integration (`/api/visibility` GET/PUT) including:

- New service `src/services/visibilityApi.ts` with typed helpers + auth header injection.
- Enhanced `WardrobeVisibilitySelector` for progressive loading (local quick read, async backend fetch) and optimistic PUT updates with rollback on failure.
- Added integration test `profileVisibilityIntegration.spec.tsx` mocking fetch to validate load + update flow.
- Installed `@testing-library/user-event` for realistic interaction simulation.

## Implementation Notes

1. Progressive hydration ensures immediate UI using cached value, then syncs real value to avoid jank.
2. Optimistic state stored separately (`optimistic`) to avoid losing original internal state during pending update.
3. Local storage still updated after successful fetch/update to support potential offline scenarios.
4. Error handling: displays inline error message if initial fetch fails; silent rollback for update errors (future enhancement: toast notification).
5. TypeScript header typing issue resolved by constructing concrete `Record<string,string>` objects before fetch.

## Files Added / Modified

- Added: `src/services/visibilityApi.ts`
- Modified: `src/components/profile/WardrobeVisibilitySelector.tsx`
- Added Test: `src/__tests__/profileVisibilityIntegration.spec.tsx`
- Dependency: `@testing-library/user-event`

## Testing

Integration test confirms:

1. Backend-provided value (`friends`) becomes selected after fetch.
2. User selecting a different option triggers PUT call.

All related tests pass locally (Vitest).

## Follow-ups (Optional)

- Surface update failure to user via toast.
- Merge duplicate legacy test file `profileVisibility.test.tsx` vs `profileVisibility.spec.tsx` to reduce redundancy.
- Add real auth token acquisition for end-to-end tests (current tests mock fetch only).

## Completion Criteria

- Frontend now reflects server-side wardrobe visibility and persists changes: Achieved.
- Optimistic UX with rollback safety: Implemented.
- Automated tests for integration path: Implemented.

Task 5.3 complete.
